# Books-API-With-React

I spent an afternoon during the weekend (week 8) on this solo task.

I used Create React App to initialise an app, created components and used an API to create a tool that allows a user to search for an author's name to find out some basic information about them.

The goal here was to solidify the weeks learning.
